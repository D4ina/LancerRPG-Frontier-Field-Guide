# LancerRPG Frontier Field Guide
 Homebrew, LCP for Titanfall in LancerRPG

## Whats Currently Available

Currently there are the 3 main Titanfall Frames from Hammond Robotics (Atlas, Stryder and Ogre).
A few modifications out of the vast variety that I plan on including,
and the base framework for the Vanguard Class Titan from the Frontier Militia. (Cause yes I do plan on adding the TF2 Titans aswell)

## Future Updates

TF2 Titans (Northstar, Tone, Ronin, Ion, Scorch, Legion
MOAR WEAPONS (Both Lore and Custom)

Hacker Frames, based on the Original 3 but take use of LancerRPGs hacking / Tech Attacks for a bit more variety.

A bunch of Titanfall themed Mech Mods

Better rules and equipment for Pilots so you can Rodeo to your hearts content.
