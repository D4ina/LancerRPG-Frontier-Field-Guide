# LancerRPG Frontier Field Guide
Homebrew, LCP for Titanfall in LancerRPG

## Whats Currently Available

Currently there are the 3 main Titanfall Frames from Hammond Robotics (Atlas, Stryder and Ogre).
A few modifications out of the vast variety that I plan on including
and the base framework for the Vanguard Class Titan from the Frontier Militia. (Cause yes I do plan on adding the TF2 Titans aswell)

Certified Pilot Trait for changing gameplay to make it feel more like titanfall. Currently it only adds 3 basic necessities for titanfall but these 3 ranks will most likely get their own dedicated traits so that pilots may pick and choose how they want their Pilots playstyle to feel.

## Future Updates

TF2 Titans (Northstar, Tone, Ronin, Ion, Scorch, Legion)
MOAR WEAPONS (Both Lore and Custom)

Hacker Frames, based on the Original 3 but take use of LancerRPGs hacking / Tech Attacks for a bit more variety.

A bunch of Titanfall themed Mech Mods

Better rules and equipment for Pilots so you can Rodeo to your hearts content.

As mentioned before the Certified Pilot Trait will most likely be split into 3 to give pilots more choice in their character builds.

### KNOWN ISSUSES!

IT IS A KNOWN ISSUE THAT if you have "The Long Rim Data .lcp" it will override some data on the Atlas frame. It is recommended that you disable other .lpc's if you are having issues with data displaying.

Should you have any other issues, feel free to DM me on discord at 'NeekoCurious#4742' or even post your problem in the issues tab.
