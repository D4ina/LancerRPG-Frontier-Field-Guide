Developed as an extremely mobile and maneuverable Titan variant, the Stryder's almost skeletal design has been optimized for superior speed and agility. Significant improvements have been made to its Dash Core, enabling it to use it more frequently, while the Titan can also sprint for greater distances, making it perfect for hit-and-run attacks, ambushes and rapid redeployments. Unfortunately, this speed comes at a price. The Stryder's design is stripped down compared to other Titan variants, and its armor is largely non-existent, making it much more fragile in combat. In Titan-vs-Titan engagements, Stryder Pilots must use all available cover and their machine's impressive speed to outflank and evade their heavier adversaries, as they are unlikely to survive a straight-up slugfest.",
